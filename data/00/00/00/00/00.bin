  |   Lethal League Blaze is an intense, high speed ball game, with         |
  |   unique characters, outta sight sounds and none of that weak shit.     |
  |   In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal.      |
  |   The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now,    |
  |   with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in     |
  |   the League for challenge and respect.                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You    |
  |   can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your         |
  |   character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds   |
  |   up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme     |
  |   velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high     |
  |   speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with       |
  |   friends and foes, by yourself in the singleplayer modes or battle     |
